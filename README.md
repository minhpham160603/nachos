This is my work (in a team of 3) for the project of CSE120 - *Principles of Computer Operating Systems* at UCSD. In this project, we implement fundamental functionalities of operating systems. 
Here are what we did in each part of the project:
- Part 1: Thread join(), sleep(), Condition Variable, Rendevous monitor class, Promise (like the JS promise).
- Part 2: File table, System calls (open, read, write, exec, exit), Virtual Memory.
- Part 3: Demand Paging, Page Swap using Clock Least Recently Used Algorithm.

It is a really fun project and I learned a lot about the underlying implementation idea of many OS concepts. This by no means serves as a reference for other students of the CSE120 course.
